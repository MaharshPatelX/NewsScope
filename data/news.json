Also, Alphabet, Apple, and Amazon all face union organising drives whose demands include that the companies adopt progressive policies.\nThe Google speaker rules, seen by Reuters, cite risk to the brand from certain talks and asks workers to 'consider whether there's a business reason for hosting the speaker and if the event directly supports our company goals.'\nIt calls for avoiding topics that could be 'disruptive or undermine Google's culture of belonging' and reiterates that speakers are barred from advocacy of political candidates and ballot measures.\n'We've always been proud to host external speakers at Google, as they provide great opportunities for learning and connection for our employees,' Google spokesman Ryan Lamont told Reuters. The updated process will 'ensure these events are useful and contribute to a productive work environment.'\nAn email introducing the policy to managers said it unifies and clarifies a patchwork of guidelines.\nGreater scrutiny threatens the free-flowing, university-like culture Google has prized since its inception.

The poll was open for 24 hours.\nMusk, Twitter's new owner, said in May he would reverse Twitter's ban on Trump, whose account was suspended after last year's attack on the US Capitol.\nMusk said earlier in the day that a decision to bring back Trump's account was yet to be made, and that Twitter had reinstated some controversial accounts that had been banned or suspended, including satirical website Babylon Bee and comedian Kathy Griffin.\nMusk's decision to ask Twitter users for guidance on who should be on the platform is part of a huge restructuring of the company, including massive layoffs.\nIn a memo on Friday to remaining employees that was seen by Reuters, Musk asked those who write software code to report to the 10th floor of the Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco by early afternoon.\nThe billionaire said in a follow-up email: 'If possible, I would appreciate it if you could fly to SF to be present in person,' adding he would be at the office until midnight and would return Saturday morning.\nHe asked employees to email him a summary of what their software code has 'achieved' in the past six months, 'along with up to 10 screenshots of the most salient lines of code.'\n'There will be short, technical interviews that allow me to better understand the Twitter tech stack,' Musk wrote in one of the emails, and asked engineers to report at 2pm on Friday.\nThe emails came a day after hundreds of Twitter employees were estimated to have decided to leave the beleaguered social media company following a Thursday deadline from Musk that staffers sign up for 'long hours at high intensity.'\nThe exodus adds to the change and chaos that have marked Musk's first three weeks as Twitter's owner. He has fired top management including former CEO Parag Agarwal and senior officials in charge of security and privacy, drawing scrutiny from a regulator.\nA White House official also weighed in, saying Twitter should tell Americans how the company was protecting their data.\nTech website Platformer reported on Friday that Robin Wheeler, the company's top ad sales executive, had been fired.\nWheeler, who told employees in a memo last week that she was staying, tweeted on Friday: 'To the team and my clients...you were always my first and only priority', with a salute emoji that has been adopted as a send off for departing employees.\nTwitter told employees on Thursday that it would close its offices and cut badge access until Monday, according to two sources. Reuters could not immediately confirm whether the headquarters reopened.\nOn Friday afternoon, the company had started cutting off access to company systems for some of the employees who had declined to accept Musk's offer, three people told Reuters.\nAnother source said the company was planning to shut down one of Twitter's three main US data centers, at the SMF1 facility near Sacramento, to save costs.\nIn his first email to Twitter employees this month, Musk warned that Twitter may not be able to 'survive the upcoming economic downturn.'

Musk also tweeted about the latest version of Twitter's content moderation policy, which seems to guarantee 'freedom of speech' but not 'freedom of reach'.\nThe billionaire further stated that all negative and hate tweets will now be 'max deboosted and demonetised', indicating that they might not be visible in users' feeds and will not receive any attention or promotion, but will still exist on the service. To find such tweets, users will have to search for them specifically. In another Tweet, Musk added that this policy applies to individual tweets, not entire accounts.\nNew Twitter policy is freedom of speech, but not freedom of reach.Negative/hate tweets will be max deboosted & demonetized, so no ads or other revenue to Twitter.You won't find the tweet unless you specifically seek it out, which is no different from rest of Internet.\nKathy Griffin was suspended from Twitter in early November for impersonating Elon Musk, soon after his decision to allow anyone with a Twitter Blue subscription to receive a blue checkmark. She was one of several people who took advantage of the chaos around the changed checkmark policy for comedic purposes. The badge had previously been displayed on accounts that were verified to have been operated by a corporation or public figure. Following widespread misuse and the brief introduction of a secondary label for verified accounts, Twitter Blue has also been suspended.\nPublic figure Jordan Peterson was banned earlier this year after violating Twitter's policy against hate speech for a tweet about the transgender actor Elliot Page, while The Bablyon Bee, a conservative satire publication, refused to delete a tweet mocking a transgender US federal government official. \nOne of Elon Musk's primary criticisms of Twitter before and after buying it has been its handling of censorship. Calling himself a 'free speech absolutist', Musk has indicated he might allow former US President Donald Trump to use the service again. Trump was banned for allegedly instigating attacks on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, but is now a Presidential candidate again, having recently announced he will run again in 2024.  \nMusk also announced the formation of a 'Content Moderation Council' to decide matters such as account bans and reinstatements, though it was not clear whether this has already been instituted or it played any part in the restoration of three prominent accounts.

    "text": "FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, facing mounting legal challenges over the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange, may have harmed his defense by speaking publicly in recent days, legal experts said.\nBankman-Fried has sought to explain the implosion of FTX and disparaged government regulators in posts on Twitter and conversations with reporters. Attorneys said such statements will likely make life more difficult for the defense lawyers seeking to manage fallout from the exchange's demise and navigate multiple federal investigations.\n'There's this old saying that a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client. The reverse is also true. An individual who is the subject of an investigation and tries to defend themselves in the court of public opinion has a fool for a lawyer,' said Justin Danilewitz, a white-collar defense lawyer at law firm Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr.\nIn a conversation with a Vox reporter published this week, Bankman-Fried blamed FTX's collapse in part on 'messy accounting,' expressed regret at his decision to file for bankruptcy and denigrated US regulators in profane terms. He later said he did not intend for the conversation to be made public.\nFTX is now facing investigations from the US Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, sources have told Reuters. On Tuesday, a group of crypto investors filed a class action against Bankman-Fried and others who promoted FTX.\nBankman-Fried's statements have already been cited in FTX's US bankruptcy proceedings. The exchange's lawyers said in court papers on Thursday that he was undermining their efforts with his 'incessant and disruptive tweeting.'\nHe has become the latest high-profile figure to continue to speak publicly despite facing serious legal scrutiny, joining a group that has included Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk, ex-pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli and former US President Donald Trump.\nControlling The Story\nLawyers almost always advise clients in litigation or facing government investigations not to speak about issues related to the case.

  "ana_text": "FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, facing mounting legal challenges over the collapse of his cryptocurrency exchange, may have harmed his defense by speaking publicly in recent days, legal experts said.Bankman-Fried has sought to explain the implosion of FTX and disparaged government regulators in posts on Twitter and conversations with reporters. Attorneys said such statements will likely make life more difficult for the defense lawyers seeking to manage fallout from the exchange's demise and navigate multiple federal investigations.'There's this old saying that a lawyer who represents himself has a fool for a client. The reverse is also true. An individual who is the subject of an investigation and tries to defend themselves in the court of public opinion has a fool for a lawyer,' said Justin Danilewitz, a white-collar defense lawyer at law firm Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr.In a conversation with a Vox reporter published this week, Bankman-Fried blamed FTX's collapse in part on 'messy accounting,' expressed regret at his decision to file for bankruptcy and denigrated US regulators in profane terms. He later said he did not intend for the conversation to be made public.FTX is now facing investigations from the US Justice Department, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, sources have told Reuters. On Tuesday, a group of crypto investors filed a class action against Bankman-Fried and others who promoted FTX.Bankman-Fried's statements have already been cited in FTX's US bankruptcy proceedings. The exchange's lawyers said in court papers on Thursday that he was undermining their efforts with his 'incessant and disruptive tweeting.'He has become the latest high-profile figure to continue to speak publicly despite facing serious legal scrutiny, joining a group that has included Tesla and Twitter CEO Elon Musk, ex-pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli and former US President Donald Trump.Controlling The StoryLawyers almost always advise clients in litigation or facing government investigations not to speak about issues related to the case. Such statements could become evidence in court and could undermine a carefully crafted defense. Social media has made it easier for clients with large public platforms to try to mount their own defense, experts said.'The basic question is who controls the story,' said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University and an expert on legal ethics.

    "text": "The government on Friday proposed a new data privacy law that allows the transfer and storage of personal data in some countries while raising the penalty for violations.\nThe draft Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Bill 2022 will be a great relief for Google, Amazon, Facebook and other global firms as it replaces an earlier version that had alarmed big tech companies over its stringent restrictions on cross-border data flows.\nThe government will 'notify such countries or territories outside India to which a data fiduciary may transfer personal data', according to the draft unveiled on Friday for public feedback.\nThe new draft will become law once Parliament approves it.\nThe proposed legislation stipulates consent before collecting personal data and provides for stiff penalties of as much as Rs. 500 crore on persons and companies that fail to prevent data breaches including accidental disclosures, sharing, altering or destroying personal data.\nCompanies are allowed to store the collected data for only specified periods.\nThe draft also gives powers to the central government to exempt state agencies from provisions of the bill 'in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India' and to maintain public order.\nWith more than 750 million internet users and the second-largest home for mobile phones, India is a big and growing market for tech giants but the previous privacy rules had riled them.\nThe draft bill covers personal data collected online and digitised offline data. It will also apply to the processing of personal data abroad if such data involves profiling Indian users or selling services to them.\n'The 2022 DPDP Bill has simplified the proposed data protection regime and done away with some contentious clauses which caused industry pushback in earlier versions. Particularly, data mirroring, data localisation requirements, and overall compliances appear to be limited compared to the previous Bill,' said Rupinder Malik, Partner at law firm JSA.\nThe legislative intent, he said, appears to be tech and IT business-friendly, focused on facilitating cross-border data flows. 'Some aspects that have been watered down could potentially reduce overall protection accorded to individual privacy rights. The positive bit is that the Bill has been drafted in a simpler manner, with less ambiguities.' The new draft legislation comes in place of the Data Protection Bill, which was withdrawn by the government in August this year. The draft is open for public comment till December 17.\nThe draft bill requires the setting up of a 'Data Protection Board' to ensure compliance. The board will also hear user complaints.\nIt requires firms such as Google and Facebook to be accountable to a 'consent manager' to provide an 'accessible, transparent and inter-operable platform' to give, manage, review and withdraw consent.\nUsers shall have the right to correct and erase their personal data.\nWhile the personal data of children cannot be obtained or processed without parental consent, the draft law provides that advertising cannot target children.\nCompanies of 'significant' size - based on factors such as the volume of data they process - would be required to appoint an independent data auditor to evaluate compliance with provisions of the law.\nThe provision in the previous version that gave the government powers to ask a company to provide anonymised personal data and non-personal data to help target the delivery of services or formulate policies, is not there in the new draft.\nThe new draft raises penalty amount to up to Rs. 500 crore for violating provisions. The draft personal data protection bill, issued in 2019, had proposed a penalty of Rs. 15 crore or 4 percent of the global turnover of an entity, whichever is higher.\n'The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the processing of digital personal data in a manner that recognises the right of individuals to protect their personal data, the need to process personal data for lawful purposes and for other incidental purposes,' an explanatory note of the draft bill said.\nThe draft proposes to set up a Data Protection Board of India, which will carry on functions as per the provisions of the bill.\n'If the Board determines at the conclusion of an inquiry that non-compliance by a person is significant, it may, after giving the person a reasonable opportunity of being heard, impose such a financial penalty as specified in Schedule 1, not exceeding rupees five hundred crore in each instance,' the draft said.\nIt has proposed a graded penalty system for Data Fiduciaries and Data Processors in case of any violation under the proposed legislation.\nData Fiduciaries are those entities which will process personal data, either by themselves or with the help of Data Processors.\nThe draft has proposed a penalty of up to Rs. 250 crore in case the Data Fiduciary or Data Processor fails to protect against personal data breaches in its possession or under its control.\nThe draft has also proposed a penalty of up to Rs. 200 crore in case the Data Fiduciary or Data Processor fails to inform the Board and data owner about the data breach.\nBesides, the bill proposes to impose a penalty of Rs. 10,000 on individuals providing unverifiable or false information while applying for any document, service, proof of identity or address etc and for registering a false or frivolous complaint with a Data Fiduciary or the Board.\nThe bill has a provision to allow entities to transfer the personal data of a citizen outside the country in cases where the processing of personal data is necessary for enforcing any legal right or claim, the performance of any judicial or quasi-judicial function, investigation or prosecution of any offence or if the data owner is not within the territory of India and has entered into any contract with any person outside the country.\n'The Central Government may, after an assessment of such factors as it may consider necessary, notify such countries or territories outside India to which a Data Fiduciary may transfer personal data,' according to the draft.\nThe explanatory note issued by the Ministry of Electronics and IT listed seven principles on which the bill is based.\nThese include the usage of personal data by organisations being done in a manner that is lawful, transparent, and fair to the individuals concerned and the personal data is used for the purposes for which it was collected.\nThe draft also has a provision to ensure that only those items of personal data required for attaining a specific purpose must be collected and it must be stored perpetually by default.\n'The Digital Personal Data Protection Bill is a legislation that frames out the rights and duties of the citizen (Digital Nagrik) on one hand and the obligations to use collected data lawfully of the Data Fiduciary on the other hand,' the explanatory note said.\nComments on the draft bill can be submitted till December 17. \n "

    "text": "Crypto analytics firm Chainalysis has disclosed that FTX owes it money in connection with the bankruptcy proceedings for the beleaguered cryptocurrency exchange. Chainalysis was listed as a creditor in filings submitted to the Delaware bankruptcy court on Wednesday, and it requested that any pertinent records be delivered to its attorneys. The partnership between the blockchain analysis company and FTX dates back at least to 2019 when they collaborated to update the exchange's anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures.\nFTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who resigned as the company's CEO when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week, revealed a partnership with Chainalysis in September 2019. While it remains unclear how much Chainalysis is owed by FTX, a day before FTX declared bankruptcy, Chainalysis shared on-chain data in a series of tweets to make sense of the impact of FTX's implosion.\n2/ Overall, while other firms may face insolvency, many market fundamentals remain stable. Reporting suggests the FTX situation stems from financial fraud rather than a blockchain or crypto-specific failure.\n'There's no sugarcoating it: The potential collapse of an industry stalwart like FTX is bad for crypto, and the market reflects that,' the company said in a November 10 tweet. 'But the industry has survived events like this before and emerged stronger. We know it will again.'\nFTX has stated there may be more than a million persons having claims in the case but is expecting to release a list of its 'Top 50' creditors by the end of this week.\nA few companies have already disclosed their own involvement with FTX, whether it be in the form of loans, investments on one of its platforms, or holdings of the FTT token.\nAccording to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, his company still possesses a substantial stock of FTT tokens. Similarly, BlockFi, a prominent cryptocurrency lender, said this week that it has 'substantial exposure' to FTX and that it is considering filing for bankruptcy and making layoffs.\nMeanwhile, in a statement submitted to the bankruptcy court in Delaware, new FTX CEO John J. Ray III disclosed that bankrupt firm Alameda Research owes a total of $4.1 billion (roughly Rs. 33,300 crore) from various parties.\nEuclid Way, one of the companies under FTX's bankruptcy filing, lent $2.3 billion (roughly Rs. 18,700 crore) to Paper Bird.\nAdditionally, Alameda Research lent $1 billion (roughly Rs. 8,118 crore) to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, $543 million (roughly Rs. 4,408 crore) to FTX's Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and $55 million (roughly Rs. 446 crore) to FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame."

The partnership between the blockchain analysis company and FTX dates back at least to 2019 when they collaborated to update the exchange's anti-money laundering (AML) and know-your-customer (KYC) procedures.FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, who resigned as the company's CEO when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy last week, revealed a partnership with Chainalysis in September 2019. While it remains unclear how much Chainalysis is owed by FTX, a day before FTX declared bankruptcy, Chainalysis shared on-chain data in a series of tweets to make sense of the impact of FTX's implosion.2/ Overall, while other firms may face insolvency, many market fundamentals remain stable. Reporting suggests the FTX situation stems from financial fraud rather than a blockchain or crypto-specific failure.'There's no sugarcoating it: The potential collapse of an industry stalwart like FTX is bad for crypto, and the market reflects that,' the company said in a November 10 tweet. 'But the industry has survived events like this before and emerged stronger. We know it will again.'FTX has stated there may be more than a million persons having claims in the case but is expecting to release a list of its 'Top 50' creditors by the end of this week.A few companies have already disclosed their own involvement with FTX, whether it be in the form of loans, investments on one of its platforms, or holdings of the FTT token.According to Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao, his company still possesses a substantial stock of FTT tokens. Similarly, BlockFi, a prominent cryptocurrency lender, said this week that it has 'substantial exposure' to FTX and that it is considering filing for bankruptcy and making layoffs.Meanwhile, in a statement submitted to the bankruptcy court in Delaware, new FTX CEO John J. Ray III disclosed that bankrupt firm Alameda Research owes a total of $4.1 billion (roughly Rs. 33,300 crore) from various parties.Euclid Way, one of the companies under FTX's bankruptcy filing, lent $2.3 billion (roughly Rs. 18,700 crore) to Paper Bird.Additionally, Alameda Research lent $1 billion (roughly Rs. 8,118 crore) to FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried, $543 million (roughly Rs. 4,408 crore) to FTX's Director of Engineering Nishad Singh and $55 million (roughly Rs. 446 crore) to FTX co-CEO Ryan Salame.",

FakeCatcher runs on a server while the interfacing is done through a Web-based platform. Ilke Demir, a senior staff research scientist in Intel Labs, along with Umur Ciftci from the State University of New York at Binghamton worked together to develop the detector.\nIntel has introduced a real-time deepfake detector and named it FakeCatcher.

This will make it different from other deep learning-based deepfake detectors which look at raw data to try to find signs of inauthenticity and identify what is wrong with a video.\n'When our hearts pump blood, our veins change colour. These blood flow signals are collected from all over the face and algorithms translate these signals into spatiotemporal maps. Then, using deep learning, we can instantly detect whether a video is real or fake', the company explains the functioning of FakeCatcher in its blog post.\nThe deepfake detector was designed by Demir and Ciftci. Elaborating on the issue of deepfakes, Demir said, 'Deepfake videos are everywhere now.
